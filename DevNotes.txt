7/14/2017 - Blender tools overhaul notes.
Addon preferences:

Global variables:
	At script startup these are populated from known values.  The properties described below can then be tokenized.
	{blend} - The name of the blend file without the .blend extension.

Preferences provide default behavior for the addon across projects.  They can be overridden on a project level by creating a 
<blend>.ini file where <blend> is the name of the blend file without the .blend extension.  When the script runs the <blend>.ini
file will be read if it exists and the default prefrences will be overridden.

Orbiter Mesh Folder: string : Note, this is not FILE_PATH because we will have replacable parameters {name} etc.
	desc:	Path where the mesh output files are placed.  Can be absolute or relative.  Relative path resolves from the OrbiterPath value.
	- \Mesh [default]
	-[ini] MeshFolder=''

Verbose builds: bool
	desc:	If true, will write out a detailed log of the mesh build process.  The filename is always BlenderTools.log and will
			always be in the same folder as the .blend file.
	-false [default]
	-[ini] Verbose='true'

Build Include File: bool
	desc:	If true an <include.h> file will be built as part of the mesh build process.
	-false [default]
	-[ini] BuildInclude='true'

Include file name: string
	desc:	The full path/name of the include file to build.  Relative paths are resolved from the .blend file location.
	-$//$(blend)\\$(blend)_mesh.h [default]
	-[ini] IncludeFilePath=''

Root namespace: string
	desc:	The outer namespace for the include file.  Scene specific entries will be in the scene namespace which can be set
			inside the blend file.
	- bt_mesh [default]
	-[ini] RootNamespace=''

Id name suffix: string
	desc:	The suffix appended to an object's name when that object's id is written into the include file.
	-Id [default]
	-[ini] IdSuffix='_id'

Position name suffix: string
	desc:	The suffix appended to an object's name when that object's position is written into the include file.
	-Pos [default]
	-[ini] PositionSuffix='_position'

Vertex array name suffix: string
	desc:	The suffix appended to an object's name when that object's vertex array is written to the include file.
	-Verts [default]
	-[ini] VertexSuffix='_verts'

Properties Panels:
Panel section titles are all 'Orbiter Tools'
==SCENE==
Output Mesh File 
[Scene.orbiter_create_mesh_file:bool:false]: Indicates if a mesh file for this scene should be created.

Namespace
[Scene.orbiter_scene_namespace:string:<scene name>]: The namespace to wrap the scene include code in.

==OBJECT==
Sort Order
[Object.orbiter_sort_order:int:50]: Determine the order for this object in the mesh file.

Mesh Flag
[Object.orbiter_mesh_flag:int:0]: Mesh flags.  See Orbiter SDK for values.

Include Position
[Ojbect.orbiter_include_position:bool:false]:  Include the objects position as a const VECTOR3 in the include file.

Include Vertex Array
[Object.orbiter_include_vertex_array:bool:false]:  Include object vertices as an array of NTVERTEX values in the include file.

==MATERIALS==
<diffuse color:alpha> OrbSDK:  "This is the colour that is diffusely (in all directions) reflected from an illuminated surface."

[Material.orbiter_ambient_color:FloatVector:<1.0>] OrbSDK "This is the colour of an unlit surface."
[Material.orbiter_ambient_alpha:Float:1.0]

<specular color:hardnes:alpha> OrbSDK: "This is the colour of light reflected by a
polished surface into a narrow beam. The power entry specifies the width of the cone into
which specular light is reflected. Higher values mean a narrower cone, i.e. sharper
reflections. Typical values are around 10. If omitted, the default value for power is 0."

[Material.orbiter_emit_color:FloatVector:<0.0>] OrbSDK: "This is the colour of light emitted by a glowing surface."
[Material.orbiter_emit_alpha:Float:<1.0>]

==TEXTURE==
Is Dynamic
[Texture.orbiter_is_dynamic:bool:false] 
OrbSDK:
"If a texture is to be dynamically updated during the simulation (e.g. instrument panels in
virtual cockpits), the texture name should be followed by the flag ‘D’. Orbiter will
decompress these textures to allow more efficient dynamic updates."
